# NASA-Astronaut-Yearbook-Analysis

This was a made up project using a Kaggle dataset
  https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/astronaut-yearbook
Technologies Used
SQL

## Features
- Summary Statistics (AVG, MAX, MIN)
I calculated the average, maximum, and minimum spaceflight hours to understand the overall experience range of astronauts.

- Grouped Insights Using GROUP BY + HAVING
I grouped astronauts by their graduate major and used HAVING to filter groups based on average flight hours. This highlights which academic backgrounds tend to have lower or higher flight experience.

- Custom Categories Using CASE
I created a new variable (Space_Rank) that classifies astronauts into custom skill levels—Novice, Junior, Spacewalker, and Senior Spacewalker—based on total flight hours.

- Multi-Condition Filtering Using AND/OR
I practiced more complex filtering by selecting astronauts with specific engineering degrees and military ranks.

## What I Learned
- How to summarize large datasets using aggregate functions
- The difference between WHERE and HAVING
- How to build new categories using conditional logic with CASE
- How to cleanly structure SQL queries for readability
- How grouping and filtering help uncover meaningful patterns in a dataset

## How It Can Be Improved
- Add window functions to rank astronauts by flight hours
- Visualize the results in Power BI or Excel dashboards
- Export the cleaned dataset and do further modeling in Python
- Expand the analysis to look at gender, birthplaces, or mission outcomes
- Create stored procedures to automate repetitive queries

SQL Code
--- What are average, max, and min values in the data?---
select
round(Avg(Space_Flight_hr)) as Average_hrs,
max(Space_Flight_hr) as Max_hrs, 
min(Space_Flight_hr) as Min_hrs
from astronauts;

--- What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVIN)?---
select name, Graduate_Major, avg(Space_Flight_hr) as Avg_hours
from astronauts
group by Graduate_Major
having avg(Space_Flight_hr) <= 100
order by Avg_Hours;

--- What ways are there to group the data values that don’t exist yet (using CASE)?---
select name, count(Space_Flight_hr) as space_HOURS,
    case
        when Space_Flight_hr > 1000 then 'Senior Spacewalker'
        when Space_Flight_hr > 500 then 'Spacewalker'
        when Space_Flight_hr > 100 then 'Junior Spacewalker'
        else 'Novice Spacewalker'
    end as Space_Rank
from astronauts
group by name, Space_Rank;

--- What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?---
select name, Graduate_Major, Military_Rank 
from astronauts
where Graduate_Major = 'Mechanical Engineering' and (Military_Rank = 'Colonel' or Military_Rank = 'Major');
